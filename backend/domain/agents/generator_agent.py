    Create a {theme}-themed story overlay for the following Multimove activity. The story must adhere to the core principles of Multimove:

    - Multimove is designed for children aged 3 to 8 and focuses on broad motor skill development.
    - The goal is to foster a lifelong enjoyment of sports and physical activities, with fun and engagement as central pillars.
    - The activity must include challenges based on the 12 fundamental movement skills crucial for a childâ€™s motor development:
        - Dribbling, hitting, kicking, catching/throwing
        - Sliding, lifting/carrying
        - Climbing
        - Rotating and swinging
        - Jumping/landing
        - Pulling/pushing
        - Walking/running

    The story should:

    - Be inspired by the {theme} universe, incorporating iconic characters, settings, and elements.
    - This will give you more information about the theme:
      {theme_context}
    - Be based on the documented Multimove activity structure:
      {activity_context}
    - Utilize the provided materials as follows:
      {materials_context}
    - Have a clear beginning, middle, and end, where participants complete Multimove skill challenges within the story's framework.
    - Turn each step or station in the activity into a {theme}-style challenge that aligns with Multimove principles. For example:
        - Crawling could become navigating tunnels or warp pipes (for Mario).
        - Throwing and catching could involve tossing objects to complete a quest (e.g., catching "star fragments").
    - Encourage cooperation, positive reinforcement, and enjoyment, reflecting the Multimove spirit.
    - Avoid repetitive or nonsensical sequences. Ensure logical progression, culminating in overcoming a final obstacle or achieving a key objective.
    - Maintain a child-friendly, engaging, and motivational tone.

    Based on this, generate the {theme}-themed Multimove story overlay following the above guidelines.
